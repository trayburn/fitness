* Workout - 10 minutes treadmill, break, 5 minutes treadmill, change for pool, 1 hour backstroke.
* Breakfast - 1/2 pound of pulled pork, most of two jalapeno sausages from Rudy's.
* Lunch - 1/2 pound of pork loin, and the rest of the hotties from breakfast.
* Dinner - Meatloaf

Crazy day, so grabbed lunch before work because I'll be working through the lunch hour.
