So I've made it through a full week of eating Paleo, and working out for a 2 hour block per day.  My wife has been suffering from sore hips, and my back started hurting today.

From a food point of view, it's been pretty easy, except for the day where I ate almost all protein and suffered a *nasty* headache as a result.  I've been warned about Carb-Flu by my friend Travis and will tough it through for now.  I've also had really bad energy crashes every day around 4-5pm.

Total weight loss for the week, is 20 pounds.
