* Workout - None, really happy for the weekend rest.  Hopefully my back will forgive me by Monday.
* Breakfast - 2 bananas during the apprentice session.
* Lunch - Eat out a Red Robin, bunless double burger, add egg, avocado, grilled mushrooms, and grilled onions.
* Dinner - boneless pork chops and two small bananas.
