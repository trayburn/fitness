 * Breakfast at 7am - Two eggs, sunny side up, served over sauteed white onions and mushrooms.  Added one glass of white wine to the sautee.  
 * Pick Me Up - [Advocare Spark][ad] Mandarin Orange, not very Paleo but still adjusting to my new wakeup time.
 * Dinner - My last pre-Paleo meal, Chicken and Dumplings freezer meal and a bowl of Richard Threlkeld's amazing Tomato Basil Soup (nearly 1000 calories by itself, and full of dairy).
